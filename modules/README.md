Modules
=======

Contrib modules should live in this directory directly, with no subdirectories.

Identify who wrote the module in a copyright section, and include your email address.

Modules should be GPLv3 licensed per the rest of Ansible and are
expected to be well tested, commented, and coded.

Updating another user's module to fix problems or upgrade it is generally encouraged.
Use a pull request to do this, try to get in touch with the original author first
if possible.

All modules should have an appropriate shebang line, such as "#!/usr/bin/env python"
using env if possible.

Users wishing to install these modules can just drop them into
/usr/share/ansible.

Thanks!
