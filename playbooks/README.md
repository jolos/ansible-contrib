Playbooks
=========

Example playbooks.

All playbooks here should be in their own subdirectory, named after your username and
the project goals, such as "mpdehaan-cowsay".

Each subdirectory should have the YAML playbook files at the top level, and a "files/",
"templates/", "tasks/", and "handlers/" subdirectory under that if needed.

Include a README.md file explaining what the playbook does and how to get in contact
with yourself, as well as the license for the playbook source content.  

All playbook content is assumed to be Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution licensed.  
Non-commerical or No-derivatives CC extensions are not acceptable.

Always name tasks steps, use comments, and significant whitespace.
